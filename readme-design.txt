- WeaponLevel1-2-3-4 is for adding in questions which monster will use to attack the player.
- For these 4 classes I extend Weapon so that I can reuse 3 methods from Weapon class, to check the answer or get the questions.

- WeaponFactory extracts questions for each level
- Study extracts contents from text files for each level
- Score is for keeping track total score of every level
- Monster class is for generating questions of each level that will be used to attack the player.
- License class is for generating the license content
- Map class handles the moves in the game
- CommandParser checks the command typed in by the player
- AviationGame starts the parser method from CommandParser
- Item class displays the player's item and also adds in the reward when the requirements is met.
