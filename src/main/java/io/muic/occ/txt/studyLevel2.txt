Work done in rolling is less than lifting due to a extra work has been done in lifting due to 
gravity means against the gravity but in rolling on a inclined plane we get a work done by 
gravity in downward direction along the gravity.

Metals are good conductors of electricity, because they allow electric charge to flow freely 
through them. According to BBC, metals contain a sea of delocalized 
electrons that are able to move throughout the metal structure.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), 
is a specialized agency of the United Nations. 
It codifies the principles and techniques of international air 
navigation and fosters the planning and development of international air 
transport to ensure safe and orderly growth. 
Its headquarters are located in the Quartier International of 
Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

An international airport is an airport that offers customs and immigration facilities 
for passengers travelling between countries. 
International airports are typically larger than domestic airports and 
often feature longer runways and facilities to accommodate the heavier 
aircraft commonly used for international and intercontinental travel. 
International airports often also host domestic flights.

Flaps are a type of high-lift device used to increase the lift of an aircraft 
wing at a given airspeed. Flaps are usually mounted on the wing trailing 
edges of a fixed-wing aircraft. Flaps are used to lower the minimum speed 
at which the aircraft can be safely flown, and to increase the angle of descent for landing.  

Thrust is the force which moves an aircraft through the air. 
Thrust is used to overcome the drag of an airplane, 
and to overcome the weight of a rocket. 
Thrust is generated by the engines of the aircraft 
through some kind of propulsion system.
